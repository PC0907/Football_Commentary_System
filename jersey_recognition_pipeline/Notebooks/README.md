## Jupyter Notebooks
Here, you may find a sample run for the jersey recognition algorithm which we had run on kaggle cloud notebooks. Please note that a CUDA environment is needed for installation of dependencies. //
Attempting to install dependencies in local environment may have conflicts. We are currently working on an alternate scenario where such a problem can be resolved. Stay Tuned !
