# Automatic Football Commentary Generator

Welcome to the **Automatic Football Commentary Generator** project! This repository contains code for a system that generates football commentary automatically by analyzing match footage. The system is designed to detect, classify, and incorporate player names, team names, and key events into commentary, giving users a comprehensive play-by-play experience.

This `README` provides an overview of the project, instructions for installation, and a tentative outline of the project's structure and modules.

## Project Overview

Football commentary plays an essential role in enhancing the experience for viewers, helping them follow the game and understand key events. This project combines computer vision and natural language processing to analyze video footage and generate contextual commentary, focusing on post-game analysis. 

**Objectives**:
- **Player and Ball Tracking**: Track players and the ball across frames.
- **Homography to a 2D plane (bird's eye view)**: Transform to a bird's eye view to gain positional insight about the game.
- **Event Detection**: Detect key events like goals, fouls, and shots.
- **Commentary Generation**: Produce contextual commentary that adds depth and excitement.

## Project Structure (Tentative)

Below is a tentative project structure to keep components organized and modular. The structure may evolve as development progresses.
